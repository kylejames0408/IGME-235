# ABOUT ME
Greetings,
My name is Kyle James. I'm a second-year Game Design and Development student at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I'm originally from Newmarket, New Hampshire, which is an old small mill town neighboring the University of New Hampshire. I love honing my programming skills, playing video games, hanging out with my friends, playing basketball, playing soccer, and listening to music. I'm always looking to try something new and expand my horizons, and I hope I can do so using this repository! I suppose that's all I have to say about myself for now. So, until later!
Sincerely,
Kyle James
